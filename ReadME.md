## Why I created this extension?
This motivation came from the LMS that I am using, which is Aralinks. This LMS has given me a bad user experience during the 3-4 years I've been using it, but we are forced to use this LMS due to the contract between my school and the company (Aralinks). So, I tried to make my experience better by creating this extension.

I started with the login. Every time I close the tab, I have to log in again. So, I created a feature that automatically logs me into my account. Then, I noticed that the left column, the subjects panel, is not expanded, so I created a script that automatically expands the left column. I realized that this extension could be even better if the materials in a certain subject could auto-expand, so I added the feature to auto-expand the materials after the page is loaded.
